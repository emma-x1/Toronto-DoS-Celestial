# Celestial
Days of Service, Hack Club's initiative to help girls learn to code, is hosting its first international event in Toronto, ON!

## About
The first phase of our event was hosted at the Rexdale Community Hub in Etobicoke, ON with Power to Girls Organization. We hosted workshops on printed circuit boards (PCBs) and 3D modelling with Figma! Our second phase was hosted at Shopify in Toronto, ON! Overall, we reached over 50 girls age 10-17, many of whom had never coded before.

## Our Goals
We hoped to reach as many girls as possible and inspire them to learn more about the field of tech. We were able to host 2 workshop streams and teach over 50 girls about tech and computer science, inspiring them to look into a career in tech. 
We also wanted to empower members of our team to learn from established women in tech. We accomplished this by hosting our team dinner, where our organizers had a chance to network with women in leading startups and large tech companies such as Shopify and Github. We're incredibly grateful for all of their support, and for their role in showing us that there is so much possibility out there!

## Our Workshops

# 3D Village
In this workshop, students learned the basics of 3D modelling within the application "Spline". They learned how to build the structure of the house and the ground that the house sits ontop of. They also learned to customize their houses by adding colours, trees, windows/doors, etc.

# PCB
In this workshop, students learned the basics of printed circuit board design! They created a light with a battery, LED, resistor, and switch using a software EasyEDA. They also personalized their PCBs by outlining it different shapes. Attendees can receive a grant for their PCB using Hack Club's program [Onboard](https://github.com/hackclub/OnBoard).

## Social Media
Celestial was mainly promoted throught social media and Instagram. Our aim was to maximize engagement, reach out to relevant communities, and drive participant registrations. We reached out to similar student groups and tech organizations to partner and increase visibility.
