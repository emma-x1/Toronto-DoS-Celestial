  <h3>Celestial is Toronto's Hackathon for Girls and Non-Binary Youth!</h3>
  </div>

  <p>Introducing the first international Days of Service event! We hope to inspire girls and non-binary 
    <a id="about"></a>
    youth to dream bigger and conquer the world of Computer Science... Join us in Toronto!</p>

  <h2>What is Celestial?</h2>
  <p> Celestial is a hackathon - you might have heard this term before! A hackathon is a social coding event - in other words, an event where participants work together on coding projects! Celestial is focused on teaching girls, young women, and non-binary youth - these groups are underrepresented in the tech industry, and we aim to make this field more accessible to them. </p>
  <p> Celestial is a two-part event: the first part, in collaboration with <strong>Power to Girls</strong>, will take place in late August, 2024! The second part will take place in October (with a more spooky theme)! </p>
  <!--idea: hover over spooky and the website changes theme-->
  <p>Celestial is part of <a href="https://daysofservice.hackclub.com/">Days of Service</a>, a program that has held similar educational hackathons across the United States! This is our first Canadian event, but we're hoping to host many more both in Canada and internationally.
  </p>

  <h2>What are we going to do at Celestial?</h2>
  <p>Our talented team is working hard on Celestial's workshops. You'll have the chance to choose one of the workshops, go through a step-by-step tutorial of the technology, then put your own spin on it! In August, our workshops are going to be printed circuit boards (PCBs) and 3D modelling. Both are exciting opportunities to learn about emerging hardware and software.</p>

  <h2>What is the day going to look like?</h2>
  <p>Here's the schedule for our August event:</p>
