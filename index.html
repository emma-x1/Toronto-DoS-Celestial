  <h1> What is a hackathon? </h1>
  <p> A social coding event - in other words, an event where participants work together on coding projects! We're
    hosting a hackathon to encourage more girls to see a space for themselves in STEM and in tech!</p>
  <p>xx event name is part of Days of Service, a program that has held hackathons across the United States! This is our
    first Canadian event, and we're hoping to host many more :)
